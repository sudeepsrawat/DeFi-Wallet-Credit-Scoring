# DeFi-Wallet-Credit-Scoring-with-XGBoost-Aave-V2-
This project builds a machine learning-based credit scoring system for DeFi users interacting with the Aave V2 protocol on Polygon. Using raw transaction-level data (~100K records), we assign each wallet a credit score between 0 and 1000, where higher scores indicate safer and more responsible on-chain behavior.
